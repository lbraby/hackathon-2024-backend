The most common methods of cooking ho fun are in soup or stir fried. Ho fun can be dry-fried (fried without sauce) or wet-fried (fried with a sauce).\n\nDry-fried beef ho fun is made by first stir frying beef strips until they are half-cooked. Bean sprouts and onions are then fried in oil. The ho fun is added and stir fried very quickly, along with soy sauce and heated oil. Finally, the beef is added.\n\nAn important factor in the making of this dish is \"wok hei\". The cooking must be done over a high flame and the stirring must be done quickly. Not only must the ho fun be stirred quickly, it must not be handled too strongly or it will break into pieces. The amount of oil also needs to be controlled very well, or the extra oil or dry texture will ruin the flavor.

Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \"The Hymn to Ninkasi\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer",

Once that's done, grind the dal really well. While it was done by hand in earlier days, a good food processor helps. Make sure there's not too much water in it though. The idea is to get a thick paste-like dough.\n\nNow take the salt and the kalonji and add it to the paste. You need to whip the mixture hard, use a hand mixer, so that the batter becomes light. In the olden days, these boris were made by hand - taking a little mixture and making tear drop shapes on a newspaper and putting them out in the sun to dry. You can of course use an icing bag with a round nozzle. If a newspaper is too pass\u00e9 for you, use a metal tray and brush it with some oil so it doesn't stick. It takes a whole day in the sun for the dumplings to dry; keep it out for longer if it takes it time.\n\nWhen it's ready it should be completely dry; crush one in your hand if it crumbles easily, it's done. You can store these in an airtight container for a few days.\n\nTo cook with it, you need to gently saut\u00e9 it in oil before adding it in anything.",

Everyone enjoys munching on these snacks at tea time or sometimes when we feel a little hungry in between meals, or even at times when we are sitting with a few friends enjoying the evening.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about masalas or spices they are the most important factor in Indian food. Different cuisines have different masala demands. Fresh, handpicked masalas are preferred most and all over to garnish Indian food.\r\n\r\nIndore.online has the best namkeens and masalas available at the click of a button, straight from the city of foodies - Indore! Handpicked from the best brands, all the namkeen and masalas are smartly packed to ensure that they retain their flavour and aroma and are crisp and fresh no matter the weather conditions.\r\n\r\nSpecial Namkeens in our lives\r\n\r\nIndia is a diverse place with different kinds of food. Indian food is eaten by people from all over the world. Namkeen is a Hindi word to recount savoury flavour. The word namkeen is acquired from the hindi word namak which means salt. Also used as a collective expression to describe savoury snack foods.\r\n\r\nClassical namkeen in Indian cuisine include khakraa, farsan, chivda, sev, chips, and bhujia. The snack industry in India has always done extremely well - every household in India needs snacks either at tea time, study time, TV time, while socialising and more so during festivals. Young and old alike enjoy these mini pleasures of life which include chips and namkeens. Namkeens of Indore and Ratlam are very well known for their enhanced flavours and original tastes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINCH OF YUMM NAMKEENS\r\n\r\n\u25cf Tikha Gathiya\r\nIt is a crunchy snack, blended salty sev with red chili, and pepper spicing that is prepared from besan. It's one of the spicier types.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Crispy Masala Puri\r\nIt is a crispy snack made from whole wheat flour that infuses the spices of red chili, pepper, ajwain, turmeric, and salt.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Maida Namkeen\r\nDeep-fried snacks with spices such as ajwain, kalonji, or jeera are added to make these strips. It is sometimes baked to make it a healthier snack.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Chivda\r\nIt is a crunchy namkeen snack made from thick poha or aval, which is flattened rice, along with dry fruit and spices. The dried fruit provides a sweeter flavour to balance the savoury snack.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Gujarati Gathiya\r\nGujarati gathiya is prepared from sev or omapodi. Pepper and carom seeds are used in this recipe, making it similar to kara sev. The gathiya, though, has a puffy appearance, is less crusty, and weighs less. The taste is also more gentle than regular sev.\r\n\r\nThere are various other mouth-watering namkeens like the authentic Ratlami Sev, Ujjaini Sev, Khatta Meetha Mixture, Instant Mix range, Papad, Chai Doodh Masala, Gajak, and the list goes on.\r\n\r\nSpecial Masalas in our lives\r\n\r\nSpices are aromatic flavouring substances used to flavour food like clove, cumin, and pepper. Our country, India grows spices in large proportions and supplies tons and tons of spices to the worldwide spice market annually. India is also known as the home of spices as no Indian food is made without the use of spices in it. Spices can be used to produce aroma and taste, and some to complement other spices.\r\n\r\nVarious Indian spices are cumin seeds, black mustard seeds, coriander seeds and powder, red chili powder, black pepper, turmeric, carom seeds, ground mix spices, asafoetida, fenugreek, cloves, jeeravan masala, cinnamon sticks, cardamom etc.\r\n\r\nBENEFITS AND APPLICATION OF EXOTIC SPICES\r\n\r\n\u25cf Cumin Seeds\r\nA cooling spice, cumin seeds are known to flush toxins, provide iron and are good for immunity.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Black Mustard Seeds\r\nThis is the most common ingredient in south Indian cooking. It is a good source of selenium and omega 3 fatty acids and is well known for its anti-inflammatory properties.",

The crispy texture and savoury flavour make it a perfect accompaniment to a cup of tea or coffee.\r\nWith Meals\r\nIndori Papad can also be served with meals.

Each type of papad offers a unique flavour profile, making it a versatile snack that can be enjoyed in many ways. Let's explore the two most popular varieties: moong dal papad and chana dal papad.\r\nMoong Dal Papad\r\nMoong Dal Papad is a light and crispy snack that is loved for its subtle flavour. Made from moong dal, or split green gram, this variety of papad is a perfect accompaniment to a meal or can be enjoyed on its own. The process of making moong dal papad involves soaking the dal, grinding it into a paste, adding spices, and then rolling it out into thin discs that are sun-dried. The result is a deliciously crispy snack that is a favourite among papad lovers.\r\nChana Dal Papad\r\nChana Dal Papad, on the other hand, is known for its robust flavour and hearty crunch. Made from chana dal, or split chickpeas, this variety of papad is a bit thicker and has a more pronounced flavour compared to the moong dal papad. The preparation process is similar to that of moong dal papad, but the use of chana dal gives it a distinctive taste and texture.\r\nWhere to Buy Indori Papad\r\nIndore.Online\r\nThe easiest and most convenient way to buy Indori papad is to order papad online.

For many people, however, the term bhuna is used to refer to a curry dish which has been prepared using these fried spices. This type of curry usually consists of meat, vegetables, or a combination of the two, cooked and served in a thick, spiced sauce. It is common throughout the Bengal region of northeast India and western Bangladesh and is also a popular menu item at Indian restaurants in the US and Europe.\n\nSpice pastes prepared using the bhuna technique usually contain ginger, garlic, and shallots. These ingredients are peeled and then pan-fried in hot oil, often until they have broken down to form a paste. This paste is then used to season curry dishes.\n\nThe dish known by many as bhuna is a curry which has been seasoned using a spice paste prepared using the technique described above. It usually consists of a meat such as lamb or chicken, along with vegetables such as onions and peppers. In some cases it may be prepared with fish or with vegetables alone. The chosen ingredients are cooked slowly in bhuna paste, which combines with the meat\u2019s juices to form a small amount of thick sauce. In some variations, coconut milk is added to the ingredients during cooking, resulting in a sauce that is thinner but more abundant than that of traditional bhunas.\n\nBhuna\u2019s origins can be traced to the Bengal area of northeast India and western Bangladesh. This method of cooking spices was originally used in preparing meals for Indian rulers and aristocrats. Over time, the technique \u201ctrickled down\u201d to the rest of Bengali society, and bhuna became a popular dish among both monarchs and commoners alike.\n\nAs Westerners have become increasingly familiar with South Asian culture and cuisine, bhuna\u2019s popularity has spread far beyond Indian shores. It has become a familiar feature on the menus of Indian restaurants in the US and in parts of Europe, particularly the countries of the United Kingdom. These restaurants commonly serve it with a side of pilau rice, sometimes including warm, flat naan bread for dipping. Most will prepare the dish using the diner\u2019s choice of meat and are willing to adjust its level of spiciness to suit the palates of those unused to the strong seasonings common to Indian cuisine. http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-bhuna.htm",

Based on an article written by Angela De Leon entitled Soul Train: The Unlikely Beginnings Of A Beloved Filipino Dish (published in Chile Pepper Magazine last October 2006), Ms. Kalaw toned down the heat on her Taro dish (this could be \u201cLaing\u201d) after receiving complains from some customers. However, she knew that other customers wanted the Taro dish to be hot and spicy so she invented another amazingly spicy hot dish that would best compliment the Taro.

It is differentiated by its use of bourbon whiskey or rye whiskey as its principal component instead of gin. Paul Clark, writing for the food blog Serious Eats, says, \"This isn't a Negroni. It is, however, the Negroni's long-lost autumnal cousin.\" He continued: A simple substitution? Hardly. The bittersweet interplay between Campari and vermouth remains, but the whiskey changes the storyline. Where the Negroni is crisp and lean, the Boulevardier is rich and intriguing. There's a small difference in the preparation, but the result is absolutely stunning.\n\nRecipes vary the proportions of its components. Some boulevardier recipes call for 1 1/2 parts rather than 1 part whiskey, or call for two parts bourbon to one part vermouth and one part campari.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevardier_(cocktail)",

Claims of authenticity call for squirrel, opossum or rabbit meat, but chicken is most commonly used in modern versions.[1] Some versions have a distinctly smoky taste. Eastern North Carolina Brunswick Stew has potatoes, which thickens it considerably. Eastern Virginia Brunswick Stew tends to be thinner, with more tomato flavor and less smoky flavor.\n\nThe stew essentially resembles a very thick vegetable soup with meat. The key distinguishing factor between soup and Brunswick stew is the consistency. Brunswick stew must be thick; otherwise, it would be vegetable soup with meat added. Most variations have more meat and vegetables than liquid.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_stew",

Bruschetta is usually served as a snack or appetizer. In some countries, a topping of chopped tomato, olive oil and herbs is marketed under the bruschetta name.\n\nIn Italy, bruschetta is often prepared using a brustolina grill. In the Abruzzo region of Italy a variation of bruschetta made with a salame called ventricina is served. Raw pork products and spices encased in pig bladder are aged and the paste spread on open slices of bread which are sometimes grilled. This was a way of salvaging bread that was going stale.

Mostly clay pots are used as packaging material for Buffalo curd. The naming curd is traditionally used in the Indian subcontinent to refer to yogurt, while another word, paneer, is used to denote curd in the British English word sense.\nBuffalo curd is obtained by bacterial fermentation of buffalo milk. In this process lactose in buffalo milk is converted into lactic acid using several micro-organisms. The species involved in the fermentation include Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus diacetylactis, Streptococcus cremoris, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus.It  has a higher nutritional value of protein, fat, lactose, minerals and vitamins. It should have 7.5% of milk fat, 8.5% of milk solids and 4.5% of Milk acid (lactic acid). Quality of the curd totally depends on the starter culture.

Those who produce cheese using Marie Harel's method, can legally call their cheese Camembert Normandie under the AOC guidelines. However, the production of Camembert cheese has now transcended the AOC designation. Very good varieties of Camembert cheese made from pasteurised milk can be found in Normandy today. The best of them is the Camembert Le Ch\u00e2telain.\n\nThe fresh Camembert cheese is bland, hard and crumbly in texture. Young Camembert has a milky and sweet taste. As the cheese matures it forms a smooth, runny interior and a white bloomy rind that is typical to Camenbert cheese. It has a rich, buttery flavour. The rind is bloomy white caused by a white fungus, called penicillium candidum.The rind is meant to be eaten with the cheese.\n\nThis cheese is best paired with a light red wine such as Beaujolais, Chenin Blanc, St Emilion, St Estephe or traditionally a glass of Normandy cider.",

The classic Peruvian ceviche is composed of chunks of raw fish, marinated in freshly squeezed key lime or bitter orange (naranja agria) juice, with sliced onions, chili peppers, salt and pepper. Corvina or cebo (sea bass) was the fish traditionally used. The mixture was traditionally marinated for several hours and served at room temperature, with chunks of corn-on-the-cob, and slices of cooked sweet potato. Regional or contemporary variations include garlic, fish bone broth, minced Peruvian aj\u00ed limo, or the Andean chili rocoto, toasted corn or cancha (corn nut) and yuyo (seaweed). A specialty of Trujillo is ceviche prepared from shark (tollo or tojo). Lenguado (sole) is often used in Lima. The modern version of Peruvian ceviche, which is similar to the method used in making Japanese sashimi, consists of fish marinated for a few minutes and served promptly. It was developed in the 1970s by Peruvian-Japanese chefs including Dario Matsufuji and Humberto Sato. Many Peruvian cevicher\u00edas serve a small glass of the marinade (as an appetizer) along with the fish, which is called leche de tigre or leche de pantera.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruvian_ceviche",

It consists of a stuffed, roasted, fresh poblano pepper (a mild chili pepper named after the city of Puebla), sometimes substituted with non-traditional Hatch chile, Anaheim, pasilla or even jalape\u00f1o chili pepper. In its earliest incarnations, it was described as a \"green chile pepper stuffed with minced meat and coated with eggs\". In current cuisine, it is typically stuffed with melted cheese, such as queso Chihuahua or queso Oaxaca or picadillo meat made of diced pork, raisins and nuts, seasoned with canella; covered in an egg batter or simply corn masa flour and fried. Although it is often served in a tomato sauce, the sauces can vary.\n\nThere are versions in Mexico using rehydrated dry chiles such as anchos or pasillas.\n\nIn the United States chiles rellenos are usually filled with asadero, asiago, or Monterey Jack cheese, but can also be found with cheddar or other cheeses. The chile is then dipped in an egg batter and either pan fried or deep fried. Variations include pecan encrusted and crab filled. Chiles rellenos are a popular cuisine in the state of New Mexico where the Hatch Chile is revered for its slender (rather than round) shape and medium to hot flavor. In the U.S., rellenos are typically served with red or green chile sauce or mole. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_relleno",

The walnut used to prepare nogada is a variety called Nogal de Castilla or Castillan Walnut, also known as the English Walnut. The name comes from the Spanish word for the walnut tree, nogal.\r\n\r\nThe traditional chile en nogada is from Puebla; it is tied to the independence of this country since it is said they were prepared for the first time to entertain the emperor Agust\u00edn de Iturbide when he came to the city after his naming as Agust\u00edn I. This dish is a source of pride for the inhabitants of the state of Puebla.\r\n\r\nSome Mexican historians believe the inventors of this dish were the Monjas Clarisas, although others think they were the Madres Contemplativas Agustinas of the convent of Santa Monica, Puebla. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiles_en_nogada",

    "Delectable Ways To Use Leftover Poha": {
        "ingredients": "poha",
        "description": "one can easily buy poha online from the Indore Online website. You may experiment quite a bit with this intriguing recipe by adding your preferred vegetables and even topping it with your preferred savoury ingredients, such as roasted peanuts, crunchy fried sev, or namkeen.\r\n\r\nMaking poha is simple, and even the preparation time is only about 15 minutes. Another justification for our enjoyment of making poha for breakfast is this. Poha is highly adaptable, so with a little imagination, even leftover cooked poha may be transformed into a variety of delectable snacks and appetisers without requiring any additional work or materials.\r\n\r\nFollowing Are 3 Delectable Ways to Use Leftover Poha:\r\n\r\nPoha Paratha\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular Indian breads is the paratha. Indians have a propensity for stuffing their parathas with a variety of tasty ingredients. Why can't you have a poha paratha if you can have a halwa paratha? It doesn't taste awful, no. In fact, the flavour of this unusual stuffed paratha will surprise you. Simply prepare your dough as you would for a standard paratha, flatten the dough balls into thin rounds, lay some leftover poha in the centre, and fold it all in to create stuffed dough balls to produce this paratha. Using the rolling pin, flatten the dough ball once more into a circular paratha after dusting it with some dried flour. Use the oil of your choice to cook the paratha on your griddle until it is well cooked. The poha paratha is flavorful, full, and crispy. Order authentic Indori poha online from Indore Online for the best taste and flavor.\r\n\r\nPoha Tikki or Cutlet\r\n\r\nOne of the nicest things you can make with leftover poha is poha tikki or poha cutlets. This evening snack is incredibly simple to prepare and delicious to bite into. The remaining poha can be combined with the spices and veggies of your choice to form tikkis, which can then be lightly roasted or fried on the griddle with ghee or oil. To enhance the taste, add some real poha masala, which you can easily get from Indore Online. To make your tikkis or cutlets crispier and tastier, mix in some mashed potatoes, then top them with toasted bread crumbs. For satisfying and tasty appetizers, buy poha online from Indore Online. \r\n\r\nPoha Pakoda\r\n\r\nPoha tikki and poha pakoda are made in the same manner, but they are cooked in different ways. The tikkis or cutlets are pan-fried or simply roasted, while the pakodas are deep-fried for a richer, heavier flavour. All you have to do is combine the leftover poha with all the spices, some chopped onions, fresh coriander, and a tiny bit of corn flour. Use your hands to thoroughly mash the mixture until it begins to come together. If the mixture seems to be disintegrating, check the consistency and add a little water. Make little balls out of the mixture after adding some mashed, boiled potatoes. These balls should be deep-fried until crisp and golden. Serve the pakodas with tomato sauce or mint chutney. To get the best taste, buy poha online from our website. \r\n\r\nThese meals can be made with cooked or uncooked poha. If you want to make these but don't have any leftover poha, all you need to do is soak the poha for 30 minutes in water, season it with some turmeric and chilli powder, and start cooking! Make sure to add salt sparingly to the final mixture if you're usin",

        "ingredients": "milk, syrup",
        "description": "Flan is a baked custard quite similar to cr\u00e8me caramel. It is typically made with eggs, cream or milk, gelatin and vanilla. Often, the custard is synonymous with cr\u00e8me caramel because it includes a layer of burnt or caramelized sugar on the bottom. Little ramekins of flan are then inverted, so the crunchy sugar is on the top.\n\nThis custard is quite popular in Latin American countries, but its origin is French. Often, flan served in Latin countries or restaurants does not have the caramel sugar layer, but instead is simply plain, more resembling Italian cream.\n\nSometimes, Latin American restaurants make the distinction between regular flan and dolce de leche, which served with a milk caramel sauce. Unlike cr\u00e8me caramel, the milk caramel sauce is added after the custard is baked and inverted. It is creamy rather than crunchy.\n\nFlan enjoys great popularity in the US, in Latin American countries, and in the Philippines. It is also very popular in Japan, where some variants may be made with soy milk, since many native Japanese do not regularly consume cow milk.\n\nThere are also some instant flan mixes available. Thickening from these tend to come from the addition of either agar or gelatin. Authentic flan would probably not use either thickener, but would depend upon the addition of eggs to create the proper thickness. Most restaurant recipes, however, suggest gelatin.\n\nhttp://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-flan.htm",

Some may say it tastes like caramel custard and others a bit like pumpkin. Its texture, unlike most fruits, is dry, quite starchy and with a paste-like consistency that melts in your mouth. You have to try it! \n\nThe scientific name for this fruit is Pouteria Lucuma and it grows best at altitudes above 1,000 up to 2400 meters. It has an ovoid shape of about 5 to 8 cm long, green yellowish color when ripe. Pealing its thin skin reveals a dry and starchy orange-yellow flesh. Peru is the main producer, although it is also now grown in parts of Chile. The bulk of the production is used in dehydrated form with only a small percentage reaching the local markets to be consumed fresh. Once dehydrated, the lucuma powder (or flour) is mainly sold as flavoring to be used in ice creams and other dairy products. \n\nhttps://www.lucuma.com/lucumafruit.asp",

Then, the liquid is continuously stirred and spun with a wooden spoon until it begins to freeze, harden, and create a pliable, soft consistency.

Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or from secretions of other insects (such as honeydew), by regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. Bees store honey in wax structures called honeycombs. The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus Apis) is the best-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption. Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping or apiculture.\r\n\r\nHoney gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (table sugar). It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years.\r\n\r\nFifteen millilitres (1 US tablespoon) of honey provides around 190 kilojoules (46 kilocalories) of food energy.\r\n\r\nFrench honey from different floral sources, indicating differences in color and texture\r\nHoney use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity. Several cave paintings in Cuevas de la Ara\u00f1a in Spain depict humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey",

        "ingredients": "",
        "description": "Jalebi is a well-known Indian sweet and ranks in the top 10 popular sweets of India. Lately born in the North region, slowly Jalebi became famous all over the country. It is consumed as a dessert or as a quick snack and can be consumed either hot or cold. You can prepare jalebi at home with the help of instant Jalebi mix from Indore Online, with 100% natural ingredients used, so to provide you with that authentic taste of purity.\r\n\r\nPreparing Jalebi with Instant Jalebi Mix\r\nYou will find a Jalebi mix, chasni powder, and a Jalebi maker in the pack, along with an easy-to-follow instructions manual, when you buy Indori Ishtyle Jalebi instant mix from Indore Online. Empty the Jalebi mix into a bowl and add water slowly to form a thick batter. Ensure to mix it well to form a well-consistent paste. Keep it aside, and meanwhile, prepare the sugar syrup with the help of chasni powder included in the pack. Consider making slight thick sugar syrup for soaking rather than dipping the jalebis. You need to mix chasni powder in water and boil it for a little time to get consistent sugar syrup.\r\nNow heat some ghee in a shallow frying pan, and pour the Jalebi batter into the Jalebi maker. Start piping round jalebis by squeezing the bottle. Try to get jalebis in the right shape. Fry on medium heat till jalebis are golden colored. Immediately dip the hot jalebis in the sugar syrup, and leave them to soak for 5-10 seconds. You can even soak for some more time if you want more juicy jalebis.\r\nDrip off the excess sugar syrup and serve the jalebis on a plate, either in their hot form or serve once they are cool, as per the individual choice.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\u2022 Adding jalebis to very hot sugar syrup will turn them soft.\r\n\u2022 In cold sugar syrup, the jalebis will not soak well.\r\n\u2022 Don\u2019t overcrowd the pan while frying jalebis as they will stick with each other. Fry them in small multiple batches.\r\n\u2022 You can consider adding a bit more water than prescribed to make the batter more consistent and easy to pour into a Jalebi maker.\r\n\u2022 Also, make one Jalebi first and check the consistency. If it is too thick, add some water to thin down the batter. It is thin, then add some more instant Jalebi mix.\r\nMaking Best Jalebis with Instant Jalebi Mix\r\nIf you want to make crispy, juicy, and light jalebis then consistency is an important key. To prepare amazing jalebis at home, you have to prepare your batter with correct consistency. The batter should be free-flowing, yet thick to help you prepare good jalebis. You can understand and fix the consistency if you struggle to prepare the right type of jalebis. If you get:\r\n\u2022 Shrunk Jalebi \u2013 These are over fried or fried in ghee with low heat\r\n\u2022 Flat Jalebis \u2013These are the result when ghee is not enough in the frying pan or prepared on low heat\r\n\u2022 Thin Jalebis \u2013 When jalebis are made with a runny batter, then they will be prepared thin.\r\n\u2022 Thick or soft jalebis \u2013 If jalebis are made with too thick batter, then they will be thick and soft.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nTraditionally making jalebis is a tough and long process.

When Japanese people want a quick, hearty meal at a restaurant they\u2019re likely to order curry, a noodle dish, or katsu don.  Katsu is a fried pork cutlet.\n\nTraditionally, most Japanese ate little or no meat, so the dish was developed after the Meiji era when Japan was opened to the wider world.  A don, however, just means rice bowl, so a katsu don is a rice bowl with a katsu (and usually vegetables and egg) on top.  If you live in Japan, you can probably find prepared katsu in your freezer section, in ether minced or tenderloin.  There are two types of katsu, one using the fatty cut, and the other lean.  If you\u2019re in a hurry feel free to fry up a quick katsu and throw it on some rice with an egg for a quick meal.  If you have a little more time, here\u2019s a recipe from scratch.

Khoa is made by simmering full-fat milk in an iron karahi for several hours, over a medium fire. The gradual vaporization of its water content leaves coagulated solids in milk, which is khoa. The ideal temperature to avoid scorching is about 80 \u00b0C (180 \u00b0F). Another quick way of making khoa is to add full fat milk powder to skimmed milk and mixing and heating until it becomes thick. This may, however, not have the same characteristics as traditionally made khoa.\nKhoa is usually used for making sweet dish like gulab jamon, jalebi etc. To make sweet dish a good taste and texture khoa is used.\n\nsource url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoa#Preparation",

German Jews started adding a dough of mostly flour and water to the center of cholent and other long-cooking stews, and then later emulated their non-Jewish neighbors who steamed such bread dumplings in a round clay pot called a kugeltopf that was placed inside of the larger pot on top of the stew.\n\nToday, kugels are typically baked alone in square or rectangular pans, and then cut into individual portions. The noodle version is frequently called a \u201cnoodle pudding,\u201d which, again, is a reference to its steamed predecessors. Adding eggs, milk, and cheese creates a custard around the noodles and produces a deliciously decadent dish, albeit an immediate elevation in your cholesterol (and possibly confused frightened faces amongst non-Jews: sugary creamy noodles? for dinner?!). This sweet version may also have raisins, apple, or pineapple, depending on how one feels about hot fruit (another contentious point for some, Jews and non-Jews alike).\nhttp://www.myjewishlearning.com/the-nosher/what-is-kugel/",

    "Looking For a Low-Calorie Snack? Try Papad": {
        "ingredients": "",
        "description": "For people that are suffering from being overweight, a pocket-friendly snack that can quench there hunger pranks is moong dal papad. When it is about eating healthy most people think about western food. It clearly shows how much people underestimate the value of Desi food. One needs to understand that healthy food does not necessarily have to be fancy or expensive. Papad can greatly help in losing weight. The fact might surprise some. But roasted papad that is served at home alongside meals is available in a wide range of varieties and is amazingly healthy. The following section discusses some of the benefits of eating papad so that people can enjoy it without any worries.\r\n\r\nIs eating papad healthy?\t\r\n\r\nAccording to health experts eating papad has always been an excellent choice. Different varieties of papad are loaded with potassium and sodium. It also contains sufficient amounts of magnesium, carbohydrate, and iron. The best option is to eat homemade papad so that one can keep track of the number of ingredients. That way they can enjoy a healthier version of papad.\r\n\r\nSurprising benefits of eating crunchy papad\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPapad helps in digestion\r\nPeople that suffer from chronic digestive issues can happily indulge in crispy moong dal papad. It produces digestive enzymes by easing the digestion process. Besides it also helps in curing other forms of gut problems by promoting good bacteria in the gut. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tLow-calorie food\r\nIndividuals that are trying hard to lose weight now have a perfect solution. They can choose to add papad but it is always advisable to ask the experts first. Also, they must stick to the quantity recommended by a dietician.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tGluten-free\r\nPapad has high concentrations of protein and can be enjoyed by people across all age groups. But one must never go overboard. Another essential thing to keep in mind is that the fried version should always be avoided. Roasted papad is the best as it does not contain unwanted oils and fat.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPacked with fiber\r\nFiber is extremely important so it is necessary to consume foods that are packed with sufficient amount of fibers regularly. Papad has an adequate amount of fiber and helps in regulating bowel movements. Due to this reason, moong dal papad also helps in keeping the weight under check.\r\n\r\nPapad as a healthy snack\t\r\n\r\nPapad is the best snacking option for those on a diet. Even it is better than nachos. But the fried version of papad is likely to be avoided. Moreover, the roasted papad can be topped with veggies to add a healthy twist.\r\nPeople who have been recommended to stay on a low sodium diet should always be mindful of their papad consumption. Papad contains high concentrations of sodium and salt which can have an adverse effect when not consumed in a controlled amount. \r\n\r\nIt is equally important to know which meals go well alongside chana dal papad. According to health experts, Indian meals such as rice and dal are incomplete without the accompaniment of papad. It has always been an excellent appetizer and satisfies the palette of all age groups. \r\n\r\nFor those looking for variety, papads are available in a wide range of options. Best part is you can now buy papad online. Masala papad can be an excellent snack since it has all the veggies. In some parts of India, papad sabzi is in great use and is something you can also try. Stuffed papad with vegetables is also a great idea for those trying to eat healthily. Papad also goes well along with dal khichdi, pulao, masala rice, and other similar dishes.",

        "description": "Introduction\r\n\r\nDo you want to add some healthful flair to your regular cooking? Make some Indori Poha with the Indori Jeeravan Masala! \r\n\r\nFor those who are unaware, Jeeravan Masala is a unique spice mixture from Indore, Madhya Pradesh. This masala is often created with more than 20 meticulously selected spices and is nothing short of a natural remedy. It is known to improve digestion and to keep the body warm in the cold. Try googling a namkeen shop near me and you would be able to find a lot of shops where you can order snacks online including sev which would be the best garnish for Poha!\r\n\r\nIn addition, Indori Jeeravan Masala is an excellent taste enhancer. It is extensively used in Indori Poha, a dish made in Madhya Pradesh with flattened rice or rice flakes that is quite delicious. The masala takes the common poha and raises it to a whole new level, setting it distinct from other foods. Since Jeeravan Masala, also known as Indore Poha Masala, is so adaptable, it may be used to notch up any food including salads, pakoras, and curries.\r\n\r\nSteps to make Indori Poha\r\n\r\nMake Indori Poha with these easy steps in your home:\r\n\r\nStep 1\r\n\r\nTake 1.5 cups poha. Wash it 1-2 times under running water by gently shifting them with your fingertips. Through a strainer, remove any extra water. Add sugar and salt according to your liking. \r\n\r\nStep 2\r\n\r\nIn a pan, heat two teaspoons of oil. When the mustard seeds begin to sputter, add the cumin seeds, green chilies, curry powder, peanuts, and asafoetida in little amounts. About 30 to 40 seconds should pass while they sizzle and the chilies get crisp. \r\n\r\nStep 3\r\n\r\nAdd the minced onions, along with salt, and cook them until they are transparent. This will take anywhere between three to four minutes. To avoid sticking, stir occasionally.\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\n\r\nAdd Indori Jeeravan Masala- the special ingredient along with the soaked poha. Mix thoroughly.\r\n\r\nStep 5\r\n\r\nCook for 2-3 mins. Add coriander and lemon juice.\r\n\r\nStep 6\r\n\r\nWhile serving, garnish it with pomegranate and sev for the perfect crunch while enjoying your Indori Poha. \r\n\r\nStep 7\r\n\r\nYour Indori Poha is ready to be served. \r\n\r\nImportant tips while making Indori Poha\r\n\r\n\u25cf\tNever let poha soak in water. Simply give them a thorough, gentle wash under running water, then put them in a strainer to let the water drain out.\r\n\u25cf\tIf you don't have a strainer, simply cover the rice flakes with a little water and let them soak. Use just enough water. Poha should be damp but not wet after soaking.\r\n\u25cf\tUse rice flakes that are medium thick. Use rice flakes that are not too thin. Also available is brown rice poha.\r\n\u25cf\tPoha can be made crispy by adding ingredients like peanuts or other dried fruits because it is very soft when it is first cooked.\r\n\u25cf\tPoha is a flavorless substance that readily absorbs any flavor you give it.\r\n\u25cf\tPoha should always be mixed or tossed carefully to prevent breaking.\r\n\u25cf\tRaw poha should always be kept in an airtight container.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuy your favorite snacks at Indore.Online\r\n\r\nInstant Indori Jeeravan Masala and other similar products from Indore.

Seeds are almond-shaped and sized.\n\nThe purple mangosteen belongs to the same genus as the other, less widely known, mangosteens, such as the button mangosteen (G. prainiana) or the charichuelo (G. madruno).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_mangosteen",

The key to the formation of a good meringue is the formation of stiff peaks by denaturing the protein ovalbumin (a protein in the egg whites) via mechanical shear. Meringues are often flavoured with vanilla, a small amount of almond, or coconut, although if extracts of these are used and are based on an oil infusion, an excess of fat from the oil may inhibit the egg whites from forming a foam.\n\nThey are light, airy and sweet confections. Homemade meringues are often chewy and soft with a crisp exterior, although a uniform crisp texture may be achieved at home by baking at a low temperature (180\u2013200 \u00b0F (82\u201393 \u00b0C)) for an extended period of up to two hours, whilst many commercial meringues are crisp throughout.",

The nuns started praying desperately and an angel came to inspire them. They began chopping and grinding and roasting, mixing different types of chiles together with spices, day-old bread, nuts, a little chocolate and approximately 20 other ingredients.. \n\n2) The other legend states that mole came from pre-hispanic times and that Aztec king, Moctezuma, thinking the conquistadors were gods, served mole to Cortez at a banquet to receive them. This story probably gained credibility because the word mole comes from the Nahuatl word \u201cmilli\u201d which means sauce or \u201cconcoction\u201d. Another connection could be that chocolate was widely used in pre-columbian mexico, so people jumped to that conclusion. \n\nhttp://www.mexonline.com/molepoblano.htm",

In this case, camote, a type of sweet potato, is mixed with macre, a type of squash, to form a silky pur\u00e9e. It's combined with flour, sugar, yeast, and anise, formed into a round doughnut shape and deep fried. The light and airy sweets are then drizzled in chancaca (chopped raw sugar dissolved in hot water until it forms a molasses-like syrup), and served immediately.\n\nPicarones is a Peruvian dessert that originated in the colonial period. Its principal ingredients are squash and sweet potato. It is served in a doughnut form and covered with syrup, made from chancaca (solidified molasses). It is traditional to serve picarones when people prepare anticuchos, another traditional Peruvian dish. Picarones were created during the colonial period to replace Bu\u00f1uelos as bu\u00f1uelos were too expensive to make. People started replacing traditional ingredients with squash and sweet potato. Accidentally, they created a new dessert that rapidly increased in popularity throughout the country.\n\nPicarones are also mentioned in the book of a famous Peruvian writer, Ricardo Palma.

The tentacles are preferred over the head, which sometimes is discarded. After the octopus has been boiled, it is trimmed with scissors, sprinkled with coarse salt and both sweet and spicy paprika (known in Galicia as pemento and pemento picante) and drizzled with olive oil. The optimal cooking point is the one in which octopus is not rubbery but not overcooked either, similarly to the al dente concept in Italian pasta cooking. This is achieved after approximately a 40-90 minutes boil, provided that the octopus is left to rest for a further 20 minutes inside the boiled water away from the fire. The dish is traditionally served on wooden plates and bread. Tradition dictates that drinking water should not accompany octopus, so the dish is usually accompanied by young Galician red wine.",

After all, it has ground meat and some bread crumbs added, too. But now I have some assumptions on why that is the shape of our Embutido and why we use pork instead of the usual ground beef.

Unless qualified, however, the term in everyday usage typically denotes a dessert; in the UK, pudding is used as a synonym for a dessert course. Dessert puddings are rich, fairly homogeneous starch- or dairy-based desserts such as rice pudding, steamed cake mixtures such as Treacle sponge pudding with or without the addition of ingredients such as dried fruits as in a Christmas pudding. Savory dishes include Yorkshire pudding, black pudding, suet pudding and steak and kidney pudding.\r\n\r\nIn the United States and some parts of Canada, pudding characteristically denotes a sweet milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based custards, instant custards or a mousse, often commercially set using cornstarch, gelatin or similar collagen agent such as the Jell\u2011O brand line of products.\r\n\r\nIn Commonwealth countries these puddings are known as custards (or curds) if they are egg-thickened, blancmange if starch-thickened, and jelly if gelatin based. Pudding may also refer to other dishes such as bread pudding and rice pudding, although typically these names derive from the origin as British dishes.",

On the Big Island of Hawai'i, it is also referred to as 'ice shave', though both terms (ice shave and shave ice) are used by locals.\n\nShaving produces a very fine ice that appears snow-like. Flavored syrups are added to the ice, which are absorbed by the ice instead of surrounding it. A properly made shave ice product rarely requires a straw, since the flavors are in the ice and not at the bottom of the cup. Although the traditional American flavors are common, shave ice in Hawai'i is often flavored with local ingredients such as guava, pineapple, coconut cream, passion fruit, li hing mui, lychee, kiwi fruit and mango. Hawaiian shave ice is traditionally served in a conical paper or plastic cup with multiple flavors and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and/or adzuki bean paste at the bottom of the cup. Sweetened condensed milk drizzled over the top is sometimes called a \"snow cap.\" This style of shave ice is common on the north shore of O'ahu, as well as on Maui and the Big Island of Hawai'i (where it is called \"Japanese style\"). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shave_ice",

There are two varieties: the white (or plain), and the red (\u7ea2\u70e7, cooked with soy sauce). The plain variety is usually stewed or steamed with napa cabbage. The red variety can be stewed with cabbage or cooked with bamboo shoots and tofu derivatives. The minced meat in the meatball tends to be made from fatty pork (lean pork making for a less desirable taste), often with some chopped water chestnut for textural variation.\n\nThe name derives from the shape of the meatball which is supposed to resemble the head of the lion and the cabbage (or other vegetables), which is supposed to resemble the lion's mane.\n\nThe dish originated in the region of Yangzhou and Zhenjiang in Jiangsu province, with the plain variety more common in Yangzhou and the red variety more common in Zhenjiang. The dish became a part of Shanghai cuisine with the influx of migrants in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nIn Northern China, especially in Beijing, the dish is known as \"Sixi Wanzi\" (\u56db\u559c\u4e38\u5b50\uff0c\"Four Happy Balls\") because the meatballs are usually served in a set of four.

However, it is a misconception that spices like Indori jeeravan masala only make the food hot and fiery. The reality is that spices provide flavor to the food, make it tasty, and are healthier. Indian dishes will usually have more than one spice in them. For example, the Indori jeeravan masala from Madhyapradesh is a blend of 20 different spices that have various medicinal properties.

Biryani, pulao, and rice pudding are a few of the dishes where this exotic spice can is mainly used.\r\n\r\nCumin\r\nIt is a very common spice used across India. While some prefer to use it for tempering purposes, others may use it in powdered form to release the aroma.

        "description": "Introduction\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy eating or snacking in any way, you must be familiar with sev, particularly Ratlami sev. It is a well-liked snack that has spread across the country because of its delectable flavour and ease of preparation. The snack is so well-liked that several varieties have been created; and these days, you can even order Ratlami sev online.\r\n\r\nBut have you ever heard the tale describing Ratlami Sev's origin? Due to the circumstances and era in which the dish was developed, it is not just an Indian snack; it also represents a significant period in Indian history. Here is the tale of Ratlami sev. \r\n\r\nWhat is Sev? \r\n\r\nAjwain, turmeric, and gram flour are used to make the crispy, salty, noodle-like Indian popular snack known as sev, which is then deep-fried in oil. Sev is known to have originated from the term siv, which means sewing and alludes to the snack's look as a bunch of threads.\r\n\r\nSev is the most popular snack in India, even more so than peanuts. The snacks are offered by street vendors that boast a variety of just-made fried noodles all over India. While some of them may be as thin as paper and unseasoned, others may be as thick as spaghetti and quite hot.\r\n\r\nSev is available packaged in stores in addition to street vendors, but it is very simple to make at home and serves as an excellent teatime snack. You could also order snacks online from Indore Online, which will deliver them to your doorstep. \r\n\r\nOrigin of Sev\r\n\r\nThe concept of sev was developed by the Bhil tribal group in Ratlam roughly 200 years ago. In the large fields next to Ratlam, they raised corn, wheat, pulses like gram, pigeon pea, and chickpea, as well as vegetables like potato, chilli, and okra. They also lived close to the forest. These tribal people are now being declared encroachers of public property and are being forced to leave, albeit Ratlam is not a scheduled region.\r\n\r\nWith widespread approval, the Ratlami sev attained Geographical Indication (GI) certification in 2014. These breakfast nibbles are frequently paired with Indori Poha, a popular local breakfast dish that comes in two varieties. Additionally, sev is added to the curries as a garnishing component, side dish, or as a serving of sev with a meal. The Mughal emperors visited western Madhya Pradesh during a journey in the late nineteenth century, and they placed an order for the dessert sewain, or wheat vermicelli.\r\n\r\nBut as wheat couldn't be found, the Bhil tribal people were instructed to produce sewain out of gram flour; as a result, the first Sev recipe was created. The makers gave this new savoury food the moniker \"Bhildi sev,\" and gradually Ratlami Sev steadily became famous as a quick snack.\r\n\r\nWhile searching for namkeen shop near me, the top result would be that of Indore.Online with a wide collection of sev to complement your kadak chai.\r\n\r\nSev in different origins\r\n\r\nSev is frequently eaten as a snack on its own or as a garnish on dishes like papdi chat, sevpuri, and bhelpuri. It can also be kept for weeks in sealed jars. It is the primary component of several evening and daytime snacks in the Madhya Pradesh cities of Ratlam, Ujjain, and Indore. This is a key ancillary factor in the conversation items in particular. These include Ratlami sev, laung sev, plain sev, Bhujiya, palak sev, and tomato sev, to name a few. The popularity of this snack has also moved elsewhere, particularly in the UK, where Bombay Mix, a popular snack prepared from sev, lentils, pulses, and nuts correctly combined, is widely consumed.\r\n\r\nWhere can you buy Ratlami Sev from?\r\n\r\nYou're tempted to try this well-known food, but you're not sure where to find it? You don't need to go all the way to Ratlam to find sev!\r\n\r\nThis hot favourite is available on Indore.Online or even as you Google \u2018Indori namkeen near me\u2019, the link to Indore.Online will come up.

The drink must have its origins in Spanish sangria, but a tizana lacks the red wine and is prepared with a wider variety of tropical fruits. The key ingredient is grenadine (granadina in Venezuela), which gives the tizana its distinctive purple/red color.\n\nTo make tizanas, many different kinds of fruit are chopped up and soaked in a mixture of orange juice and limeade. The mixture keeps for a week or so in the fridge, as the fruit flavors intensify. Some people like to mix it with soda before serving. Serve the tizanas with the plastic straws that have a spoon at the end if you can find them, so you can enjoy the fruit that remains in the bottom of the glass once you've finished the drink.\n\nThough not traditional, this drink would be delicious as a cocktail, combined with rum, cacha\u00e7a, or another aguardiente. \n\nhttps://www.thespruce.com/la-tizana-tropical-venezuelan-fruit-drink-3029212",

Tonkatsu originated in Japan in the 19th century. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonkatsu\n\nTonkatsu is one of the most beloved \u201cwestern style\u201d Japanese foods in Japan.  It is pork chop breaded with flour, egg, and Panko (bread crumbs), then deep fried.  It\u2019s not the healthiest food but rather comfort food.  There are a lot of nice Tonkatsu restaurants in Japan, but it might be hard to find one in the US since it\u2019s such a specialized store.  Good news is, though, making Tonkatsu at home is very easy.  Most of the ingredients in the recipe are easily found at US supermarkets.  After all, it is a \u201cwestern style\u201d dish.\n\nPanko (bread crumbs) we used here is Japanese, but most US supermarkets carry it.  It is medium size bread crumbs and that is perfect for Tonkatsu.  Italian bread crumbs are too fine and that doesn\u2019t give crunch we want.  On the other hand, coarser bread crumbs like fresh bread crumbs you make at home could absorb too much oil and might make Tonkatsu greasy.\n\nTonkatsu sauce is an important seasoning for Tonkatsu.  Tonkatsu is good by itself, but Tonkatsu sauce completes this dish.  The sauce is a Worcester-based sauce but much thicker.   It is available at Japanese markets or online stores, but if you can\u2019t find it, you can make it by mixing 1 part Worcester sauce and 2 parts ketchup (at least something similar).\n\nTonkatsu is almost always accompanied by thinly shredded cabbage.  I don\u2019t know exactly why, but probably it cuts grease of Tonkatsu or something\u2026. Anyways!   You\u2019ll definitely see how Tonkatsu and cabbage complement each other if you eat them together!\n\nThere are a lot of variation of dishes you can make with Tonkatsu, too, such as Katsudon (Tonkatsu and eggs cooked in seasoned dashi over rice, yummy!), Katsu Sandwich (sandwich with Tonkatsu as filling, my favorite), and Kastu Curry (curry and rice topped with Tonkatsu, sinfully good\u2026).

The filling is in the center surrounded by nori, then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber or carrots.\r\n\r\nExamples of variations include the rainbow roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced maguro, hamachi, ebi, sake and avocado) and the caterpillar roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced avocado). Also commonly found is the \"rock and roll\" (an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside).\r\n\r\nIn Japan, uramaki is an uncommon type of makimono; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan, the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi#Uramaki",

According to the Milwaukee Journal, the steps are:\r\n\r\nCook eggs. Stuff eggs into fish. Cook the fish. Stuff the fish into cooked chickens. Stuff the cooked chickens into roasted sheep. Stuff the roasted sheep carcass into a whole camel . . . now cook to taste.\r\n\r\nThere is a reference in culinary expert Richard Sterling's book The Fearless Diner in which he claims to have met someone who cooked the entire recipe for \"some sheik or other,\" in Saudi Arabia.
